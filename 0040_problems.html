		<h1>DOM As the Source of Truth</h1>

		<h2>Problems</h2>

		<p>Let's solve for very common problems. We'll mostly solve table-related issues to keep it simple</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Sorting a table</li>
			<li>Filtering a table</li>
			<li>Graphing a query</li>
		</ul>

		<p>These are relatively easy problems that we've probably all solved a few times.</p>
